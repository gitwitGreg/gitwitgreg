### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I've been enjoying application development for the first time since I built my first Next.js application, "UDoc." 
The simplicity of routing and advantages of specified server and client components encourage me to continue exploring Nextjs. 
I'm currently on the lookout for a full-stack developer role, ideally writing in TypeScript. I'd especially love to work for a startup
where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
